This repository is for the SpaceBlenders NAU Senior Capstone Project for the USGS
The goal of this project is to integrate existing tools from GDAL, and other
open-source scripts, to process DTM images in Blender. We aim to automate the
process of importing DTM's into Blender and simplify the creation of Flyover
Animations of DTM images.
